## Introduction

ATOM, as the name suggets is the building blocks of all matter in the world and form the basis of foundation of all existant. We believe this course " Introduction to Software engineering for engineers" as a perfect course for building the basics and foundation in programming skills which would help us to learn more higher levels of programming in later stages of career.The bonding between the atoms are so powerful that it's nearly impossible to split them just like the bonding among ourselves within the team, from the start till the end. We have always been benefited and acquire enomorous amount of knowledge from the practical works than the mere theoretical course of study which being one of the most important highlight of this course lead us to take the decision to choose this course.

Our Team "ATOM"s main objective is to make a Android Application which supports the functionality of Activity tracker. We plan to develop a activity trackers which registers all the activities done by the user on daily basis and reminding the users off the To do lists so that the user can manage and schedule all the activities:be it personal or professional.This would make life so simple for the users. We would like to apply all these functionalities and also, keeping the application so user friendly.

## Team name
We chose to have our team name as “ATOM” because it forms the foundation of matter in this world and is the most minute detail of all physical things existing. Similarly, we need to learn the basics of programming concepts which is the basic aim of this course “Introduction to Software engineering for Engineers”. From the android application perspective, the ATOM application binds together all the activities that the user performs so that it becomes a perfect activity tracker for the user which in turns increases the Customer Satisfaction Index.
