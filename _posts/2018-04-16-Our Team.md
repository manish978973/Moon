Hello Everyone, Welcome to the first blog post from Team- ATOM. Our team comprises of four unique atom members with different complimentary skills and we believe the Android application, Activity tracker will be the result of our collective efforts.So lets flag off the blog with our teams persepctive and motivation.


Our team members:

We chose to have our team name as “ATOM” because it forms the foundation of
matter in this world and is the most minute detail of all physical things existing.
Similarly, we need to learn the basics of programming concepts which is the basic
aim of this course “Introduction to Software engineering for Engineers”. From
the android application perspective, the ATOM application binds together all the
activities that the user performs so that it becomes a perfect activity tracker for
the user which in turns increases the Customer Satisfaction Index.


Upon careful observation of our team logo, each letter of our team’s name is
visible in an illusionary manner. “A” stands for Adaptability, adhering to the
changing requirements, “T “stands for Team work, “O “stands for Observant to
the adhering quality and code standards as per customer requirements and generic
protocols and “M “stands for Managerial skills. It’s not who we are underneath,
but what we do that defines us.

<u>What Motivated Us?</u>


As a team, our aim is to gain hands on experience in developing an android
application by successfully completing the project and understand the real world
requirements. We chose “Activity Monitoring” as the project because it is
something which totally benefits ourselves in tracking our daily academic
activity.



When it comes to Manish, he always aspired to develop an android application
so that he can explore and garner as much knowledge in this field. This project
fortunately has given him an opportunity to achieve his passion. So for him, this
experience will mainly enhance his programming skills. Hence, down the line, he
expects himself to be a good team player and simultaneously, he forsee to
improve his management skills too.

For Abhijith, this project helps to improvise his coding and design skills. He will
be indulging in blog which will be very challenging apart from his desire to learn
new stuffs.

For Anusha too, she would like to strengthen her coding skills and take up
challenges which she believes will make her more adaptive to varying
environments.

When it comes to me, I would like to enhance my leadership and program solving
skills and actively take part in all design activities. I believe this project be a
helpful platform for me.

<u>Interdisciplinary Skills</u>

 <p2><center>Complimentary Skills</center></p2>


Each atom compounds to become a molecule which can do a particular and
specific task ie, Two or more atoms of different skill set combines to form a
molecule which collectively performs a specific task thereby achieving the goal.
This is what happens in our team “ATOM”. As the name implies, it is a team of
four with each person having a unique skill set : ATOM 1 (Anusha Mathew) uses
her analytical ability and problem solving skills, ATOM 2 (Manish Rama
Chandran) brings in his managerial and leadership skills, ATOM 3 (Abhijith
Remesh) uses his creativity and script writing skills and ATOM 4(Vishnu
Mohan) provides high Intelligent Quotient, Emotional Quotient, and optimistic
environment which binds all the atoms together to complete the project with
collective and optimal effort. The team believes in the quotes” The most
unparalleled word in this world is deed” and “Every expert was once a beginner”
“The journey of a thousand miles begin with one step and to make one step, we
first have to DO IT!!!And to Do It, We need the Will to Act and Do”
We can’t simply work as a programmer, rather a level above in the minds of the
customer. Our fear and laziness outweighed our Will. We have learnt to bury our
laziness with Will, and then confront it to face the challenges. Even if we think
with the same frequency and wavelength, our thoughts conflicts with each other
which obviously generates different opinions. This would help us in refining the
solutions for any problems that we may encounter in later stages.

<u>Responsibilities</u>

The roles and responsibilities are equally divided among the team members.
Anusha is the principal lead, who manages the team and uses her exceptional
problem-solving skills. Manish is responsible for all presentation designs and
internal team meetings whereas Abhijith is responsible for the design of blog
content and oversee that the team is on track with respect to the deadlines.
Vishnu is responsible for the end to end/phase level testing of the application
code and keeps track of the minutes of all meetings. Even though each member
is assigned a specific role, we ensure that everyone works in sync during the
development phase and assist each other for the timely completion of the
android application.

<u>Communication</u>

The progress of the project including merging and updating the work is tracked
using GitHub whereas Zen Hub is used for overall project management. Besides,
we make use of WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangouts and G Mail for the internal
discussions.

<u>Flexibility</u>

We work using the V formation algorithm where one person takes the lead and
instructor position for a while. The lead position switches and rotates in a timely
cyclic manner to spread the work pressure equally among the team members. This
method becomes efficient when one is equipped with other priority issues,
wherein he or she can delegate the lead position among the members for efficient
progress. Eventually, this method will improve the managerial and leadership
skills of each person.

Another way to improve internal flexibility is by planning,
scheduling and prioritizing the activities according to the severity. This can be
achieved using agile methodology for internal meetings, Kanban board for
progress tracking and milestone accomplishment. The Kanban board will be
updated weekly so that the tasks and schedules can be moulded in accordance
with the varying requirements of the customer. Moreover, the same will be shared
with the customer so that he/she will be aware of the current status of the project.
Eventually, the customer can make suggestions if necessary and would lead to
good customer satisfaction index.

Another way to improve team foundation is by creating a comfortable space for
each person and share healthy criticism so that one can understand another’s
perspective. We firmly believe that the secret to success lies within us and need
to embrace the energy within us to form an optimistic environment. We plan to
strengthen the team bonding by conducting frequent internal team meetings and
hang-outs so that the word “TEAM” realises into “ACTION” rather than a mere
word.

That’s all for the month of April. We will be back next month with a new post
which will brief the” Requirements and Specifications” of the customer.
